## Project Overview

This system is built using a **three-tier architecture** that separates concerns and enables scalability, maintainability, and flexibility:

### Architecture Layers

1. **Client Layer (Presentation Tier)**
   - Built with **Blazor** (C#)
   - Provides an interactive and responsive user interface
   - Handles user interactions and client-side logic

2. **Logic Server (Business Logic Tier)**
   - Developed with **Java** and **Spring Boot**
   - Implements core business logic and rules
   - Manages data processing and business logic
   - Handles authentication and authorization (AuthN/AuthZ)

3. **Persistence Server (Data Access Tier)**
   - Built with **.NET** and **gRPC**
   - Utilizes **Entity Framework Core** for data access
   - Manages database operations and data persistence
   - Ensures data integrity and consistency

### Key Technologies

- **Frontend**: Blazor
- **Backend Logic**: Java, Spring Boot
- **Backend Persistence**: .NET, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core
- **Security**: Authentication & Authorization mechanisms
- **Architecture**: Three-tier distributed system
